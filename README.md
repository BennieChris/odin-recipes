In this project, I will be creating
My first website from memory displaying mastery
of the html basics and showcasing what I have learned.
The idea will be to make a interlinking website with
outside resources linked in to show.
I will also be learning to pick up Git as a skill 
and learning how to use it effectively throughout this project.
